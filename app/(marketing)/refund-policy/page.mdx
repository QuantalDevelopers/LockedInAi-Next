## LockedIn AI Refund Policy

**Effective Date:** 5/28/2024, 12:00:00 AM  
**Last Updated:** 2/17/2025, 12:00:00 AM

At LockedIn AI, we are committed to providing high-quality AI-powered interview preparation tools to help you succeed. We understand that circumstances can change, so our refund policy is designed to be clear and fair.

## 1. Subscription Refund Policy

Our subscriptions provide immediate access to premium AI services, which are digital and non-returnable. Because of this, no refunds are offered once a subscription has started. To ensure LockedIn AI is right for you, we encourage using our free trial before purchasing.

### Monthly and Quarterly Subscriptions

- **Non-refundable once started.**
- **Cancellation allows continued access until the billing cycle ends, but no refunds or prorated credits.**

### Annual Subscriptions

- **Eligible for a partial refund if canceled within 7 days of purchase.**
- **No refunds after 7 days, but access remains available until the end of the billing cycle.**

## 2. Managing Your Subscription

Modify or cancel your subscription anytime through LockedIn AI account settings. Cancellations must be made before your renewal date to avoid charges.

## 3. Refund Eligibility for Accidental Purchases or Billing Errors

If you believe you were charged incorrectly, contact support within 7 days of the transaction.

Refunds may be considered for:

✔️ **Duplicate Purchases** – Charged more than once for the same subscription.

✔️ **Product Not Delivered** – No access granted after payment.

✔️ **Billing Errors** – Charged after canceling before the renewal date (must provide cancellation confirmation email).

For accidental plan purchases, reach out immediately, and we’ll review your request.

## 4. Credit Usage & Subscription Policy

- **Unlocked Credits Never Expire** – They remain in your account indefinitely.
- **Post-Subscription Access** – Credits work with general AI models, but professional models require an active subscription.

## 5. Refund Processing & Timeline

If eligible, refunds are processed:

✔️ **Within 5-10 business days to the original payment method.**

✔️ **A confirmation email will be sent once processed.**

## 6. Plan Upgrades & Prorated Charges

Upgrading adjusts your plan, and you’ll be charged only for the prorated amount based on the remaining time in your billing cycle.

🔹 **Upgrades take effect immediately.**
