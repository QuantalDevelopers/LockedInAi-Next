Preparing for a job interview is no joke, and behavioral interview questions can be some of the toughest to answer. These questions are designed to assess how well you've achieved things in the past and how you've solved problems. The good news? Preparation and practice will allow you to develop thoughtful responses that demonstrate your best qualities. Here is the top 50 list of behavioral interview questions to help you earn your next interview.

## What Are Behavioral Interview Questions?

Behavioral questions typically start with phrases like:

- "Tell me about a time when..."
- "Give me an example of..."
- "Describe a situation where..."

The expected outcome is that you evaluate your past behavior as a predictor of future performance. Employers want to know what you’ve accomplished, how you've handled challenges, worked in teams, dealt with pressure, and solved problems.

## How to Answer Behavioral Questions: The STAR Method

Use the **STAR Method** to structure your answers effectively:

- **Situation**: Set the context for the scenario.
- **Task**: Explain your role in the situation.
- **Action**: Describe the steps you took to address the challenge.
- **Result**: Highlight the outcome and what you learned.

### Example:

**Question**: Tell me about a time when you handled a difficult customer.

**Answer (STAR)**:

- **S**: At my previous retail job, a customer was upset about a delayed order.
- **T**: My responsibility was to resolve their frustration and find a solution.
- **A**: I listened to their concerns, apologized sincerely, and expedited the shipment while providing a discount.
- **R**: The customer appreciated the effort, left a positive review, and remained a loyal client.
