LockedIn AI is now a serious contender for live interview support within the quickly growing world of AI tools. But what about its competitors? In this article, we have given you a comparative analysis of LockedIn AI’s review and features to its competitors to assist you in making a good choice.

## What is LockedIn AI?

LockedIn AI is a leading-age tool that helps during interviews in a live setting. While several platforms in the market help to prepare for interviews, LockedIn AI is more about the actual interview help. It has advanced functionalities such as Coding Copilot for exception evaluation in technical interviews, and OA Copilot for helping you excel in online evaluations.

### 2. Coding Copilot

Through the encouragement of programming bug fixes, solving coding problems, and formatting answers, this feature makes technical interviews easier to handle.

### 3. OA Copilot

- **Overview:** Pramp is a site for practicing mock interviews but is free and involves practice by students only.

- **Pros:** Provides practice settings in a concurrent collective way.

- **Cons:** It does not have an actual interface and no support for real interviews only mock Interview scenarios.
