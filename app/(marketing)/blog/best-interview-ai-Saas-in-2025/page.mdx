From video interviewing to real-time coaching, the competition is fierce, but one tool stands out from the crowd: Lockedin AI. Here are the best interview AI tools of 2025 and how Lockedin AI tops the list.

### 1. Lockedin AI

The difference with Lockedin AI isn't just an interview tool, it's a full career support platform. This combines cutting-edge features, to offer a seamless and effective experience to both candidates and recruiters.

- **Unlimited Plan:** Prepare without limits. With our Unlimited Plan, you can access Lockedin AI as much as you need, with no restrictions.

- **Real-Time AI Coach:** Compared to other tools that rely on static or pre-recorded feedback, Lockedin AI provides real-time coaching during mock interviews. This feature gives candidates the freedom on the fly to refine their responses.

- **Customizable Font Size:** Our new scroll bar allows you to adjust the font size to your preference, ensuring your screen is always clear and easy to read.

- **Audio Intelligence with Multilingual Support:** Communicate effortlessly with our advanced audio intelligence. Lockedin AI supports 42 languages, including bilingual capabilities for Spanish and English, giving you the tool to ace interviews in multiple languages.

- **Comprehensive Online Assessments:** Lockedin AI covers it all from technical exams, and quizzes to pre-interview screenings so you have nothing to worry about.

- **Unique Selling Point:** While other tools are competitive, Lockedin AI involves real-time, interactive learning and filling that gap between getting ready and going.

### 2. SparkHire

SparkHire’s super video interviewing is a favorite among recruiters. It simplifies screening candidates by offering one-way and live interview options which guarantee consistent engagement.

### 3. Codility

Codility is a technical role-focused platform that provides customizable coding challenges and real-time feedback. Although it does not suit all of your interview needs. It is mainly for behavioral coaching and live mock interviews.

### 4. Modern Hire

It’s based on predictive analytics and AI-powered video interviews, helping you create deep insights into candidate suitability. While it has some very advanced predictive tools, its lack of real-time coaching makes it not as attractive for candidates wanting immediate feedback.

### 5. VidCruiter

Customizable workflows and real-time analytics make VidCruiter special. VidCruiter is a great choice if you are looking to brand your recruitment with interactive features and a candidate-first approach.

## Key Attributes Why Lockedin AI Is the Number One

What makes the Lockedin AI stand out among others may be discerned from the following discussion.

Lockedin AI now offers upgraded mock interview capabilities. It provides professionals with fully simulated interview environments, creating a similar experience to an actual interview for you to use to practice more effectively. This mock interview option offers tailored feedback, practice sessions, and question sets that replicate real industry scenarios.

## Real-Time Interview Assistant

Lockedin AI introduces a real-time interview assistant, a groundbreaking feature to support professionals during live interviews. The assistant provides:

- **Dynamic Question Suggestions:** Based on the responses, it recommends real-time follow-up questions, enhancing the interview process's quality.

- **Real-Time Notes and Analysis:** It captures key points from the conversation, offering instant analysis and summaries for both recruiters and candidates.

- **Bias Mitigation:** Advanced algorithms help identify and flag potential biases in questions or evaluations, ensuring a fair and inclusive process.

## Competitor Features Missing

Many leading tools lack critical functionalities that Lockedin AI delivers:

- **Live AI Coaching:** Examples of other companies include Codility and SparkHire which focus on static assessments instead of interactive and real-time guidance.

- **Mobile Optimization:** Lockedin AI is a seamless device-compatible platform while platforms like VidCruiter are desktop-centric.

- **Community Support:** On the other hand, the community on Lockedin AI is a lively, active one, in contrast to platforms with barely there or non-existent communities.

Lockedin AI aims to offer a new way in which recruits think about their career path with advanced online assessments. Unlike other interview AI tech offerings, it focuses on interactive, real-time coaching and preparation tools, thus setting a new standard in interview AI innovation.

Lockedin AI is a valuable tool for anyone entering interviews or the job market—it's more than a tool; it’s a partner in success.
