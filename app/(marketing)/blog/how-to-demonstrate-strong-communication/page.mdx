## Why Both Technical and Communication Skills Matter in Interviews

Imagine that you’re in the middle of a technical interview and you’re confident in your ability to solve the problem. But you notice the interviewer looking confused as you explain your thought process. What happened?

Or maybe you ace the communication part! You are engaging, clear, and confident, but then stumble when it’s time to demonstrate technical expertise.

If either of these scenarios sounds familiar, you’re not alone. Many candidates struggle with balancing technical skills and communication during interviews. Strong technical expertise will get your foot in the door, but clear, structured communication is what convinces hiring managers that you’re the right fit.

In this guide, we’ll break down:

✔️ Why communication matters just as much as technical skills  
✔️ How to explain your technical thought process clearly  
✔️ Avoiding common mistakes

By the end, you’ll be able to confidently articulate your expertise in any interview.

## 1. Why Communication Skills Are Just as Important as Technical Skills

Many candidates believe that if they’re technically strong, the rest will fall into place. The job will come to them. But that’s not always true. Considering today’s globalized workplace, you’re competing with exceptional candidates from across the world.

### 1.1. Hiring Managers Are Evaluating More Than Just Your Code

Even in highly technical roles, hiring managers are looking for more than just the right answer. The interviewer wants to see how you think, how you problem-solve, and how well you can work with a team.

💡 **Hiring Manager Perspective:**  
"I’ve interviewed many candidates who were great at solving problems but struggled to explain their thought process. If I can’t follow their reasoning, how will they collaborate effectively in a team?"

✅ Strong communication skills show that you can:

- Work well with others (essential for team-based projects).
- Clearly explain complex concepts to both technical and non-technical colleagues.
- Be an effective problem-solver by breaking issues down logically.

### 1.2. Employers Want Candidates Who Can Grow into Leadership Roles

Even if you’re applying for an individual contributor role, many companies prefer candidates with leadership potential.

✔️ If you can clearly explain your ideas,  
✔️ Work well with cross-functional teams, and  
✔️ Communicate technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders,  
…you’re far more valuable than someone who can only write great code.

## 2. How to Showcase Technical Expertise While Communicating Effectively

Now that we know why communication matters, let’s talk about how to integrate it into your interview responses.

### 2.1. Use the Think-Aloud Method

One of the best ways to demonstrate both technical ability and structured thinking is to verbalize your thought process while solving a problem.

#### How to Do It:

Instead of jumping straight into coding, walk the interviewer through:

- **Understanding the Problem** – Restate it to ensure clarity.
- **Breaking It Down** – Identify constraints, edge cases, and possible solutions.
- **Explaining Your Plan** – Before coding, outline your approach step by step.
- **Coding While Talking** – Highlight what you’re implementing and why.
- **Reviewing Your Solution** – Check for optimizations and explain any trade-offs.

💬 **Example (Before Think-Aloud Method):**  
"Okay, I’ll just start coding a function that sorts the array."

💬 **Example (After Think-Aloud Method):**  
"First, I’ll check the constraints—do we have a fixed array size or should we optimize for scalability? Given that we need an efficient solution, I’ll use a quicksort implementation instead of bubble sort. Let me walk you through how I’ll implement this…"

✅ **Why This Works:**

- Helps interviewers follow your reasoning and see your problem-solving approach.
- Shows you can explain your work—a key skill for real-world collaboration.

### 2.2. Adapt Your Communication to Your Audience

Each person in your interview panel won't have the same level of expertise.

If you’re speaking to:

- 👩‍💻 **A fellow engineer** – Go deep into algorithms, optimizations, and efficiency trade-offs.
- 📈 **A product manager or recruiter** – Focus more on high-level problem-solving and impact.

💡 **Example:**  
"For fellow engineers, I’d explain how my approach optimizes time complexity. For a product manager, I’d highlight how my solution improves user experience by reducing load time."

✅ **Why This Works:**

- It shows you understand different perspectives within a company.
- You’ll make a stronger impression on both technical and non-technical interviewers.

### 2.3. Use Simple, Clear Language

Many candidates try to sound highly technical, but overly complex explanations can actually hurt you.

💡 **Better Approach:**

- Use real-world analogies to explain complex concepts.
- Break large ideas into simple, structured points.

💬 **Example:**  
🚫 "We implement an LRU caching strategy to minimize database hits and improve query latency."  
✅ "To speed up performance, we use a caching system that remembers frequently used data—kind of like how your phone stores recent apps for quicker access."

✅ **Why This Works:**

- Shows you can explain technical ideas clearly.
- Helps non-technical stakeholders understand your decisions.

## 3. Common Communication Mistakes in Technical Interviews (And How to Fix Them)

Even technically strong candidates can struggle with poor communication habits. Here’s how to avoid the biggest mistakes:

### Mistake #1: Rushing Into the Solution Without Understanding the Problem

🚫 "I’ll just start coding—this problem seems straightforward."

✅ "Before coding, let’s clarify any edge cases. Are we assuming all inputs are valid?"

### Mistake #2: Being Too Quiet While Coding

🚫 [Silently writing code for five minutes]

✅ "Here’s what I’m thinking: I’ll first implement the basic structure, then refine it for efficiency."

### Mistake #3: Using Overly Complicated Language

🚫 "I’ll implement a recursive approach with memoization and a space-time tradeoff."

✅ "I’ll use recursion to avoid redundant calculations, which speeds things up."

## 4. Conclusion

To truly excel in interviews, you need both technical expertise and strong communication skills.

### Key Takeaways:

✔️ Think aloud while solving problems to show structured thinking.  
✔️ Adjust your communication based on your audience.  
✔️ Use clear, simple language—avoid unnecessary jargon.  
✔️ Break down solutions step by step instead of jumping straight into code.

By mastering both technical problem-solving and communication, you’ll set yourself apart as a well-rounded candidate who can code, collaborate, and lead effectively.
